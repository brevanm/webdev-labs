SQLAlchemy allows you to use Python logic/code to interact with many different variations of SQL
databases. This is intended to make interacting with SQL databases more convenient.

A model is a python class representation of a SQL datatable. It is python object that can be interacted with
like normal while SQL Alchemy does all the SQL commands under the hood

A view is an established link between a client and certain portion of a database using
Flask RESTful.
